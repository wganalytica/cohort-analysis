# cohort-analysis

This cohort analysis uses Python to manipulate data from the SQL and Google Analytics database to update an online Google sheets. The Google sheets groups users based on week, and each week's number of users, average session duraiton, number of completed modules per user, and number of referrals executed per user is listed. A cron job can be set up on a server to automatically run the .py version of this file and update the Google sheets.
